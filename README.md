## Things to keep in mind

### Developed for and driven by the community

This is mainly a platform providing the space and technology for a common basis of curated components; their development
is mainly driven by the community and adapted out of the work done in projects and through the huge amount of feedback
that we're gaining out of the community. So please support us in any way possible, this is greatly appreciated!

## How to start developing / contributing

If you're working as a developer on the DB UX Design System or would like to contribute (many kudos for that !), please have a look at the relevant [development documentation](docs/development.md). We even also tag issues that might be a good starter for code contributions by the [tag "good first issue"](https://github.com/db-ux-design-system/astro/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22good%20first%20issue%22).

## Give us your feedback!

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD033 -->

This is only the first version of our framework and we really want your feedback - either within
the <a href="https://db.de/krnm74" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DB UX Design System Channel by Web Dev Community in
Microsoft Teams (only available DB internally)</a>, or directly
at [db-ux-designsystem@deutschebahn.com](mailto:db-ux-designsystem@deutschebahn.com). <!-- markdownlint-disable MD033 -->
We're particularly keen to add as many examples to the behaviours as possible, to further clarify them.
